        Seeding Accounts for Kindergartners and Hoping to Grow College Graduates

        New York City is giving every public school kindergartner $100 in a

          Kindergarten often brings a flood of notices about events, school
          supplies and class photos. But when Vaniqua Hudson-Figueroa’s daughter
          started at a public school in Queens, there was one that Ms.
          Hudson-Figueroa wasn’t expecting: The city had opened a college
          savings account in her child’s name — and it already had $100 in it.
          For Ms. Hudson-Figueroa, the account opens up possibilities she didn’t
          know she had when she was her daughter’s age. “When I was a kid,
          nobody spoke about college,” she said. “There was nothing to talk
          about.”
        </p>
      </section>
      <p>
        The account for her daughter, Mia Issabela, was started four years ago
        as part of a pilot program. Now New York City is opening the savings
        accounts for every public school kindergartner. Roughly 70,000 students
        are receiving a college savings account with $100 already invested and
        the potential to receive up to $200 more. The establishment of a program
        by the largest school system in the country is the latest governmental
        endorsement of accounts meant to use modest investments to help set
        every child on the path to education beyond high school. By the time the
        kindergartners are ready to graduate from high school, the average
        account is projected to be worth roughly $3,000 — hardly enough to cover
        books for a four-year degree, even today. But proponents say their value
        exceeds mere dollars: Researchers have suggested that even small sums in
        a dedicated college account can significantly increase a child’s
        likelihood of pursuing higher education. Ms. Hudson-Figueroa, a
        29-year-old personal assistant and now the president of the P.T.A. at
        her daughter’s school, said the account had sparked conversations about
        higher education that never happened for her. Her father died when she
        was 14, and her mother was unable to work after having several strokes.

        “My daughter thinks about it all the time,” said Ms. Hudson-Figueroa,
        who is pursuing a dual bachelor’s and master’s degree in education and
        psychology. “She knows she has money in there.”
      </h4>
      <p>
        Child savings account programs — also known as child development
        accounts — have been steadily gaining momentum over the past decade,
        with initiatives stretching from San Francisco to Maine, two of the
        earliest pioneers. The money is generally invested in state-run 529
        college savings plans, where earnings grow tax-free over time.
        Withdrawals are free of income and capital gains taxes as long as the
        money is used for eligible expenses associated with higher education or
        career training. State and local governments, as well as school
        districts and nonprofit groups, set up these programs intending for them
        to become not only part of the classroom conversation but also part of
        the community fabric. With the account infrastructure in place, it
        becomes easier for local groups, corporations and others to direct money
        to local students, experts said, particularly those with fewer
        resources. “I certainly began my research thinking about how really
        small amounts of money can matter,” said William Elliott III, a
        professor of social work at the University of Michigan who found that
        even modest accounts make a child three or four times as likely to
        pursue higher education. “But I don’t want to lose track of the fact
        that one of the really important things these kinds of programs do is
        they provide the infrastructure to transfer wealth to lower-income
        families.” Professor Elliott can relate. He grew up in poverty in Beaver
        Falls, Pa., dropped out of high school and can recall taking walks with
        his mother through more affluent neighborhoods where they fantasized
        about living someday. That helped them get through the day, he said, but
        it didn’t give them any sense of tangible hope. The accounts can,
        Professor Elliott said, by offering students and parents a sense of
        control.

        “They feel like they can change their destiny and their future,” he
        said.

        New York’s program automatically enrolls all students regardless of
        their household financial or immigration status. Shortly after receiving
        news of their child’s $100 account, families are encouraged to take a
        series of steps to earn more: Activate the account; open their own 529
        account, link it to the scholarship account; and deposit at least $5
        into their own. At each of those steps, which will be possible beginning
        in January, they will earn up to $25. After that, they will receive a
        dollar, up to $100, for every dollar saved from first through fifth
        grade. All money is invested in the NY 529 Direct Plan, in a basket of
        low-cost Vanguard mutual funds, which gradually become more conservative
        as high school graduation approaches. Students must use the scholarship
        money within 20 years of completing kindergarten; otherwise, it will be
        returned to the program to help future students. “The big idea is that
        every kid graduating is going to have a real resource for their higher
        education for college or career training,” said Debra-Ellen Glickstein,
        executive director of NYC Kids RISE, the nonprofit organization that
        manages the program in partnership with the city and its Department of
        Education. “That is a message that is being sent from the school, and it
        is a tool for communities, no matter which community that is, to
        reinforce the message about what is possible,” she added. For every
        public dollar invested, the city expects a return of $15 to $20,
        generated through philanthropy, family savings, scholarships and
        investment returns. The city said it would invest $15 million in the
        program through 2025, while the Gray Foundation, through NYC Kids Rise,
        provided an additional $15 million.

          In 2019, California, Colorado, Illinois and Nebraska passed
          legislation to create programs, and according to Prosperity Now, there
          were more than 922,000 children’s savings accounts in 36 states at the
          end of 2020. That was up 30 percent from the previous year, with most
          growth driven by state and city-run programs with automatic
          enrollment, including Maine, Pennsylvania, Nevada and San Francisco.
          Pennsylvania’s Keystone Scholars program, created in 2018, is one of
          largest statewide programs, and automatically provides newborns with
          $100. Devon Tiller’s 6-month-old son, Ayvion, was one of them. Just a
          few months after he was born, Ms. Tiller, a single mother who recently
          started a second job as a material handler in a warehouse, received a
          letter explaining that a college account had been opened for her son,
          with materials on how she could also set up one of her own. “I had
          talked to my mom about it, and she and I thought it would have been an
          amazing thing to get started for my son,” said Ms. Tiller, 29, of
          Lancaster, who is also trying to open up an account for her 7-year-old
          daughter, Nevaeh. Feeling unprepared after high school, Ms. Tiller
          struggled in community college and ultimately dropped out. “I know
          life is hard,” she said, “and I don’t want to see them struggle like I
          have to.” Child savings accounts were conceived 30 years ago by
          Michael Sherraden, founder of the Center for Social Development at
          Washington University in St. Louis, who proposed creating accounts for
          all children at birth. Since 2007, he has been the lead investigator
          in an experiment tracking 2,700 newborns in Oklahoma randomly assigned
          to two groups: Half received $1,000 accounts at birth; the other
          received nothing. Many programs draw on the center’s research, which
          has found that the accounts raise both the parents’ and child’s
          expectations about the child’s future.

      </p>

        Thus far, the biggest beneficiaries of 529 accounts have been
        more-affluent families who open them on their own. There were 14.3
        million 529 accounts totaling $437 billion in assets at the end of June,
        according to ISS Market Intelligence, a financial research and analytics
        firm. But proponents believe that automatically starting accounts will
        help change that, and can ultimately contribute to narrowing the wealth
        gap; New York’s so-called baby bonds program is just one part of a
        broader economic justice initiative. In the pilot school district,
        certain Astoria students living in public housing already have more than
        $1,500 in their accounts, thanks in part to scholarships raised through
        the tenant association. A similar effort helped Ms. Hudson-Figueroa’s
        daughter, now in fourth grade, raise her balance to more than $500. The
        Woodside Houses Resident Association helped raise $35,800 — roughly $218
        each — for first through fourth graders at P.S. 151. As the school’s
        P.T.A. president, Ms. Hudson-Figueroa is now helping other parents,
        answering questions and guiding them through the steps they need to take
        to maximize the savings they’re eligible for.

        “The main question I get most of the time is, ‘What do I have to do?’”
        she said. “And the best part of it is, I can tell them, ‘Your child is
        already enrolled.’”
