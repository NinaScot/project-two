        The NYC Kids RISE Save for College Program provides families, schools,
        and communities with a way to work together to invest in and save for
        their children’s futures. It is a scholarship and savings program
        designed to make college and career training more accessible and
        achievable for public school students. It enables all of us to work
        together to build assets and support expectations of educational and
        economic success for every child.

        <p>What is the NYC Kids RISE Save for College Program?</p>
      </div>
      <p>
        The NYC Kids RISE Save for College Program is a scholarship and savings
        program designed to make college and career training more accessible for
        all NYC public school students— regardless of family income or
        immigration status.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through the Save for College Program, unless their parent/guardian opts
        out, every kindergarten student enrolled in a NYC public school
        (including participating charter schools) automatically receives a NYC
        Scholarship Account. This account is invested in a 529 plan with a $100
        initial deposit from NYC Kids RISE. You can also receive up to $200 in
        early rewards. Communities can contribute to these NYC Scholarship
        Accounts to further increase the savings in each account and demonstrate
        their community’s support for every child’s success. As a participating
        family, you may also open and connect your own college savings account
        through the online platform. Then, you can start saving yourself in ways
        and amounts that make sense for your finances.
      </p>
      <p>
        This Program enables parents/guardians, family members, friends,
        schools, communities, businesses, and government to work together to
        build assets and support expectations of educational and economic
        success for every child.
      </p>
      <div class="question">

          How does the scholarship part of the Save for College Program work?
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        Once your child is enrolled in the program, NYC Kids RISE will create an
        NYC Scholarship Account and deposit an initial $100 toward your child’s
        educational future. Over time, NYC Kids RISE will continue to offer
        opportunities for your family to earn more money in this account.
        Community organizations, businesses and others can also add to the
        scholarship accounts to help your child reach their college and career
        goals.
      </p>
      <p>
        The scholarship funds are invested in New York’s 529 College Savings
        Program Direct Plan, a type of account specifically designed to help
        families save for higher education. Your child’s NYC Scholarship Account
        can gain or lose money over time, depending on financial markets and the
        performance of the investment.
      </p>
      <p>
        You will receive a Welcome Kit from NYC Kids RISE when your child’s NYC
        Scholarship Account is opened. For you to access your child’s NYC
        Scholarship Account and view the amount in it for the first time and
        throughout your child’s educational journey:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>You will NOT be required to deposit money</li>
        <li>
          You will NOT be required to provide your Social Security Number (SSN),
          Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN), bank account, or
          credit card information
        </li>
        <li>
          You will NOT be required to provide economic or immigration status
          information
        </li>
        <li>There is NO maximum or minimum income to participate</li>
      </ul>

        <p>How does the savings part of the Save for College Program work?</p>
      </div>
      <p>
        After your child receives their NYC Scholarship Account, you will
        receive more information on how to create a college savings plan that is
        right for you and your family. To build on the money invested in your
        child’s NYC Scholarship Account, you will have an opportunity to open
        and connect your own college savings account through the platform. As
        opposed to the NYC Scholarship Account which is owned and managed by NYC
        Kids RISE, you own your college savings account. You, your relatives,
        and your friends can contribute directly to this account. Depending on
        which option you choose, your family can track your own savings balance
        along with your child’s NYC Scholarship Account through NYC Kids RISE’s
        online platform, Savings Tracker. There are a variety of ways to learn
        about your options, including reading information on our website and
        associated materials, attending an NYC Kids RISE workshop, calling our
        hotline, emailing our info address, making a 1:1 appointment with us, or
        going to a free financial counseling appointment at an NYC Financial
        Empowerment Center.

      <div class="question">
        <img
          src="./Assets/Pink leaf icon.png"

        <p>Why was the Save for College Program created?</p>
      </div>
      <p>
        It can be difficult to save for a child’s educational future. For many
        families, sending their children to college may seem out of reach. NYC
        Kids RISE, in partnership with the City of New York and the NYC
        Department of Education, started the Save for College Program to support
        families to begin saving and planning for college and career training
        from their child’s very first days of school. Research shows that
        children with a college savings account of between $1 and $500 are three
        times more likely to enroll in college and more than four times more
        likely to graduate. Research also shows that children who attend college
        earn a significantly higher salary over their lifetimes and are less
        likely to be unemployed.
      </p>
      <div class="question">
        <img
          src="./Assets/Pink leaf icon.png"
          alt="pink leaf Icon"
          width="56"
          height="56"
        />
        <p>How does immigration status affect my ability to participate?</p>
      </div>
      <p>
        It doesn’t! All eligible students can participate in the Save for
        College Program regardless of immigration status.
      </p>
      <p>
        Families DO NOT need to provide a Social Security Number (SSN) or
        Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN) for the child to be
        enrolled in the program and receive an NYC Scholarship Account.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, when considering whether to open your own savings account to
        save alongside the NYC Scholarship Account, please note that the savings
        accounts currently available through the program do require either a
        Social Security Number or Individual Taxpayer Identification Number to
        open. In addition, if you choose to open and connect a NY 529 Direct
        Plan as your savings option, you must meet the IRS definition of U.S.
        citizen or resident alien with a verified U.S. address. If you do not
        have this information, remember that a family member or trusted friend
        can open an account for your child.
      </p>
      <p>
        You DO NOT need to open your own account to receive and keep the free
        NYC Scholarship Account.
      </p>
      <div class="question">
        <img
          src="./Assets/Pink leaf icon.png"
          alt="pink leaf Icon"
          width="56"
          height="56"
        />
        <p>
          What can the money in the NYC Scholarship Account be used for? Are
          there any restrictions on how it can be used? What if my child does
          not attend college?
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        If a student in the Program does not claim their NYC Scholarship Account
        funds within 20 years after they complete kindergarten, then those funds
        will go back to NYC Kids RISE to support future Save for College Program
        students.
      </p>
      <p>
        Money in the NYC Scholarship Account is invested in the NY 529 Direct
        Plan and can be used for a variety of higher education expenses. And
        even though the 529 account is called a college savings account, the
        account can be used to pay for qualified higher-education expenses at
        any eligible institutions in the US and abroad. In addition to
        traditional 4-year colleges and universities, other types of eligible
        institutions include: community colleges, trade and vocational schools,
        and online degree programs. Visit nysaves.org for a full list of
        qualifying higher education expenses.
      </p>
      <p>
        Money in the NYC Scholarship Account cannot be used for any K-12
        expenses, including those that qualify under federal law.
